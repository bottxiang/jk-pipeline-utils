## Contribution
Please take a moment to review these guidelines in order to make the contribution process easy and effective for all engineers involved.


### Feature requests
Feature requests are welcome. But take a moment to find out whether your request fits with the scope and aims of this library or if the feature you wish to request hasn't been already implemented completely or partially and provide as much detail and context as possible.

### Pull requests
Good pull requests - patches, improvements, new features - are a fantastic help. They should remain focused in scope and **avoid duplication** of features and functionalities.

Before embarking on coding for any significant pull request please discuss with everyone involved in this project and adhere to the following Prerequisites and conventions.

**PR Prerequisite questions:**
- Does the feature (function) already exist in the library?
- If the feature (function) exists, should it be improved or fixed?
